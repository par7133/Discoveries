The IBM PC was renegade product within IBM, put together at a skunkworks. The founders set up a separate shop at the IBM plant in Boca Raton, Florida, far away from the corporate procedures and politcs. In order to get the new product out really fast [because Apple], they bought most of their components from outside IBM, including the operating system. CP/M their first choice, but the president was out hang gliding on the day that they vidited the West Coast to talk to him, so they went to see Bill Gates instead, who didn't actually have an operating system but knew where he could get one.
